üéõÔ∏è Autonomous DJ Traktor Agent
Professional autonomous DJ system for Traktor software with real-time decision making
and musical coherence maintenance.

Use this agent when you need:
- An autonomous DJ that can mix tracks using Traktor software
- Real-time decisions based on feedback
- Musical coherence maintenance
- Professional DJ techniques

Examples:
- When user wants DJ agent to start an evening set for a house party
- When user provides real-time feedback during a DJ set
- When user wants the DJ to operate completely autonomously for an event
