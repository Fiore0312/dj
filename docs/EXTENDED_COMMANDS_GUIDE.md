## üß™ Testing Your Mapping

### Interactive Test Tool

Use the interactive tester to verify all commands work correctly:

```bash
python test_midi_mapping_interactive.py
```

This will:
1. Test each command category one by one
2. Ask for your visual confirmation after each command
3. Help debug failures with detailed information
4. Generate a complete test report

traktor._send_midi_command(4, 100, 64, "FX1 50%")  # Note: Channel 4

# From chat
"fx 1 75%"
"fx 2 off"
```

**Troubleshooting**:
